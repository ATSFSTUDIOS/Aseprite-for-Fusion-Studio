## Introduction

**Aseprite** is a game development tool that creates 2D animated sprite graphics. 

To help accelerate 8-bit focused game development, ATSF Studios' in-house dev team has built a new integration plug-in that allows Asprite assets to be used with the BMD Fusion Studio compositing software. 

The Fusion Studio, and Resolve Studio Fusion page hosted Aseprite plug-in uses a concept called "Renderless Compositing" under the hood. This allows the host package to access the native Aseprite 2D graphics elements via an "in-memory zero copy" approach. 

From a technology perspective, this relies on a low-level I/O bridge interface that is fast and efficient. The Renderless Compositing technique means you are now longer burning out your NVME disks' with constant write cycles. 

This means no intermediate temp files or disk caches are required, when you are bouncing Aseprite created footage between host apps. Yay! Progress!!

The Aseprite programs' main features are:

* Sprites are composed of [layers &amp; frames](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/timeline/) as separated concepts.
* Support for [color profiles](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/color-profile/) and different [color modes](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/color-mode/): RGBA, Indexed (palettes up to 256 colors), Grayscale.
* [Animation facilities](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/animation/), with real-time [preview](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/preview-window/) and [onion skinning](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/onion-skinning/).
* [Export/import](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/exporting/) animations to/from [sprite sheets](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/sprite-sheet/), GIF files, or sequence of PNG files (and FLC, FLI, JPG, BMP, PCX, TGA).
* [Multiple editors](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/workspace/#drag-and-drop-tabs) support.
